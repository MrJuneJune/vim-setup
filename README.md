# My vim setup

Simple vim setup I use for my work flow.

## How to install and start 

```
./start.sh
```

## Reasoning

I started out using VSCode when I started coding around 2015? I think it was using around 2GB of RAM or something crazy like that. Anyway, I experimented with different set ups since VSCode feels sluggish and I just want to write a text into a file to code. I experimented with vim with plugins and then used neovim, but with all honesty, All I want is being able to grep easily so creating this.
