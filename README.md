# My vim setup

Simple vim setup I use for my work flow.

## How to install and start 

```
./start.sh
```

## Reasoning

I started out using VSCode when I started coding around 2015? I think it was using around 2GB of RAM or something crazy like that. Anyway, I experimented with different set ups since using vim with plugins, neovims, and etcs

I realized that IDE is not needed and I just want to write a text into a file to code so updating my vimrc with simple shell script to add two plugins I use; fzf and wiki.
